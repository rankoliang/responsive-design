# Responsive Design

This project was built to practice responsive design by building a clone of
https://www.thenextweb.com as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design).

CSS grid, flexbox, and media queries were used extensively throughout this project.
You can view the site at https://rankoliang.github.io/responsive-design/.
Try resizing the viewport on desktop to test the site's responsiveness.
